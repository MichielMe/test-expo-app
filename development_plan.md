# AAC App Development Project

## Project Description

This project aims to develop an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) app for non-verbal children with autism. The app will display pictograms/images that speak the associated word when touched, helping non-verbal individuals express themselves. Unlike existing solutions that are often expensive and have suboptimal user interfaces, this app will be freely available and designed with a focus on usability and customization.

The app will be developed for Android, iOS, and web platforms using a cross-platform approach. Initially, it will function locally without cloud dependencies, with potential for expanded features in future iterations.

- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Local Storage**: SQLite
- **Backend** (future): FastAPI, Python

## Development Notes

- Focus on making the app work offline first, with cloud features as optional enhancements
- Ensure all voice data is cached locally to minimize data usage
- Prioritize performance and responsiveness over visual effects
- Design with extensibility in mind to allow for future feature additions
- Test regularly with the target user group to gather feedback
- Keep accessibility as a primary concern throughout development
